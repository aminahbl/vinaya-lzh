<lzh>比丘尼安居竟二部僧中受自恣者。比丘尼至自恣日受自恣已。明日清旦應一切往比丘僧所受自恣。尼僧中應羯磨。一尼能受自恣者。羯磨人應作是說。</lzh>

When the bhikkhunīs have finished the rains retreat, they should perform the invitation ceremony in both sanghas. On the invitation day, the bhikkhunīs perform the invitation ceremony, and on the next day at dawn, they should all go to the bhikkhu sangha to perform the invitation ceremony. The bhikkhunī sangha should do a formal act (to appoint) a bhikkhunī who is able to perform the invitation. The master of ceremony should say: 




<h2>Saṅghakamma</h2>


<lzh>尼僧聽。某甲比丘尼能為尼僧作自恣人。若僧時到僧羯磨某甲比丘尼為尼僧作自恣人。諸尼僧聽。某甲比丘尼為尼僧作自恣人。僧忍默然故。是事如是持。</lzh>

“May the bhikkhunī sangha listen. Bhikkhunī So-and-so is able to act as the person who invites on behalf of the bhikkhunī sangha. If the right time has come for the sangha, may the sangha do a formal act (to appoint) bhikkhunī So-and-so to act as the person who invites on behalf of the bhikkhunī sangha. May the bhikkhunī sangha listen. Bhikkhunī So-and-so will act as the person who invites on behalf of the bhikkhunī sangha. The sangha accepts this, therefore you’re silent. This matter is remembered thus.”


<lzh>比丘尼僧二眾各和合者。應作是說。比丘尼僧和合比丘僧和合自恣說。若見聞疑罪。僧當語。我哀愍故。若見聞疑罪當如法除。第二第三亦如是說。</lzh>

If there is a bhikkhunī sangha, and both assemblies are in harmony, she should say: “The bhikkhunī sangha in harmony invites the bhikkhu sangha in harmony. If you’ve seen, heard, or suspected an offense, the sangha should speak out of compassion for us. If you’ve seen, heard, or suspected an offense, we’ll remove it according to dhamma.” A second and third time are recited in the same way. 


<lzh>若比丘僧和合。眾多比丘尼者應作是說。眾多比丘尼比丘僧和合自恣說。若見聞疑罪。僧當語。我哀愍故若知若見當如法除。第二第三亦如是說。</lzh>

If there is a bhikkhu sangha in harmony, and a group of bhikkhunīs, she should say: “A group of bhikkhunīs invites the bhikkhu sangha in harmony. If you’ve seen, heard, or suspected an offense, the sangha should speak out of compassion for us. If we know and see it, we’ll remove it according to dhamma.” A second and third time are recited in the same way. 


<lzh>若比丘僧和合。一比丘尼者應作是說。我比丘尼比丘僧和合自恣說。若見聞疑罪。僧當語我哀愍故若知若見當如法除。第二第三亦如是說。</lzh>

If there is a bhikkhu sangha in harmony, and one bhikkhunī, she should say: “I, a bhikkhunī, invite the bhikkhu sangha in harmony. If you’ve seen, heard, or suspected an offense, the sangha should speak out of compassion for me. If I know and see it, I’ll remove it according to dhamma.” A second and third time are recited in the same way. 


<lzh>若眾多比丘比丘尼僧和合者。應作是說。比丘尼僧和合諸大德自恣說。若見聞疑罪。諸大德當語。我哀愍故若知若見當如法除。第二第三亦如是說。</lzh>

If there is a group of bhikkhus, and a bhikkhunī sangha in harmony, she should say: “The bhikkhunī sangha in harmony invites the venerables. If you’ve seen, heard, or suspected an offense, the venerables should speak out of compassion for us. If we know and see it, we’ll remove it according to dhamma.” A second and third time are recited in the same way.


<lzh>若眾多比丘眾多比丘尼者應作是說。眾多比丘尼諸大德自恣說。乃至第二第三亦如是說。</lzh>

If there is a group of bhikkhus, and a group of bhikkhunīs, she should say: “A group of bhikkhunīs invites the venerables. …” A second and third time are recited in the same way.


<lzh>一比丘乃至一比丘尼者應作是說。我比丘尼大德自恣說。若見聞疑罪。當語我哀愍故若知若見當如法除。第二第三亦如是說。</lzh>

If there is one bhikkhu, and just one bhikkhunī, she should say: “I, a bhikkhunī, invite the venerable. If you’ve seen, heard, or suspected an offense, you should speak out of compassion for me. If I know and see it, I’ll remove it according to dhamma.” A second and third time are recited in the same way. 


<lzh>比丘尼安居竟。應如是二眾中受自恣。若比丘尼十六日不詣比丘僧受自恣。至十七日往受自恣者。越敬法。是名比丘尼第八敬法。</lzh>

When the bhikkhunīs have finished the rains retreat, they should perform the invitation ceremony in both sanghas in this way. If a bhikkhunī after 16 days hasn’t gone to the bhikkhu sangha to perform the invitation ceremony, and she goes on the 17th day to perform it, she transgresses against this rule of respect. This is called the bhikkhunīs’ eighth rule of respect.
