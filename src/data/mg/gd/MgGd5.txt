Probation for half a month.
If a bhikkhunī transgresses against a rule of respect, she should undergo probation for half a month in both assemblies. If she breaks the 19 saṅghādisesas, she should undergo probation for half a month in both assemblies. She should act in accordance with the rules in the bhikkhunī sangha, and should inform both sanghas every day. This is called both sanghas. This is what is called “a bhikkhunī should undergo probation for half a month in both assemblies”. The fifth rule of respect is finished.
