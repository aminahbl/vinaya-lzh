        "The Buddha was staying at Vesālī. To be explained in detail as in the rule about Bhaddā bhikkhunī. The Buddha said: “It’s not allowed to bathe naked. She should use a bathing robe. It’s not allowed to enter a river or a pond naked to bathe. She should wear the rains robe. If she bathes naked, she breaks a minor vinaya rule. If she bathes naked in an avoided, hidden place or a place without people, there’s no offense. This is called the rule on the bathing robe.”"
