        "The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time, a bhikkhunī touched the body with all kinds of things, and emitted sexual fluids. She inserted turnip roots, scallion roots, and various other roots into her vagina and emitted sexual fluids. For this reason, the bhikkhunīs went and informed … “From now on, it’s no longer allowed. If a bhikkhunī takes turnip roots or scallion roots, inserts them into her vagina, and emits sexual fluids, to relieve a lustful mind, it’s a thullaccaya.” This is called the rule on roots."
