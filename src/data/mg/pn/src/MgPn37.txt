<beginchinese>有三因緣非比丘。何等三。心決定捨戒。有實事僧驅出。形轉為女。是名三非比丘。應遣詣比丘尼精舍。不得共比丘尼同覆障應別。若後還得男根者。當還比丘僧中。故名具足。亦復本歲<endchinese>

There are three reasons for which someone is no longer a bhikkhu. Which three? He decides to give up the training, there are valid reasons for the sangha to expel him, or he turns into a woman. These are called the three reasons for which someone is no longer a bhikkhu. (If she has turned into a woman,) she should be sent to a bhikkhunī monastery. She may not be in a concealed place together with the bhikkhunīs, and should stay apart. If she later turns back and acquires male genitals, he should return to the bhikkhu sangha. He’s still called fully ordained, and also keeps his previous seniority.
