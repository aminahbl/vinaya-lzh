<beginchinese>佛住舍衛城。爾時大愛道往至佛所。頭面禮足却住一面。時大愛道白佛言。世尊女人形臭得聽洗不。佛言得洗。時比丘尼洗外內猶故臭。以是因緣往白。乃至言得洗內不。佛言得洗。洗法者得齊一指節。不得令過。若過洗以。歇欲心者偷蘭遮是名洗法。<endchinese>

The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time, Mahāpajāpatī went to the Buddha, paid respect with her head at his feet, and stood at one side. Then Mahāpajāpatī said to the Buddha: “World-honored One, women’s genitals stink. May we be allowed to wash them?” The Buddha said: “You may wash them.” Then bhikkhunīs washed them outside, but the inside still stank. For this reason, she went and asked again. … She said: “May we wash inside?” The Buddha said: “You may wash. The method of washing is: One may to go in one finger joint. One may not go deeper. If (a bhikkhunī) washes deeper inside, to relieve a lustful mind, it’s a thullaccaya.” This is called the rule on washing.
