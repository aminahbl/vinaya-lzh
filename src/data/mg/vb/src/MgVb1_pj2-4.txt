The second, the third, and the fourth rules are as explained in detail in the bhikkhu rules.




Final Ruling


<beginchinese>若比丘尼於聚落空地。不與取隨盜。物主或捉或殺或縛或擯出。咄女人汝賊汝癡耶。比丘尼如是不與取波羅夷。不應共住。<endchinese>

If a bhikkhunī in a village or the wilderness takes what isn’t given to steal it, an object for which the king would either arrest or kill or bind or exile her, saying: “Hey, woman! You criminal, you fool!,”—a bhikkhunī who in this way takes what isn’t given is pārājika, and shouldn’t live in community.

Final Ruling


<beginchinese>若比丘尼自手奪人命。求持刀與殺者。教死歎死。咄人用惡活。為死勝生。作如是意如是想。方便歎譽死快。因是死非餘者。是比丘尼波羅夷。不應共住。<endchinese>

If a bhikkhunī with her own hand takes someone’s life, seeks and takes a knife to give to an assassin, teaches death, or praises death, saying: “Hey you, what use is this bad life? Death is better than living on!,” if, having such intentions and thoughts, she praises and glorifies the pleasure of death with skillful means, and someone dies for this reason, not for another reason, that bhikkhunī is pārājika, and shouldn’t live in community.

Final Ruling


<beginchinese>若比丘尼未知未了。自稱得過人法。聖知見殊勝如是知如是見。彼於後時若撿挍若不撿挍犯罪。欲求清淨故便作是言。阿梨耶我不知言知不見言見空誑不實語除增上慢。是名比丘尼波羅夷不應共住。<endchinese>

If a bhikkhunī, not yet knowing and understanding, claims to have attained a superhuman state, noble extraordinary knowledge and vision: “I know in this way, I see in this way,” and at a later time, whether she’s being examined or not examined about committing the offense, desiring purification, she says: “Venerables, I, not knowing said I know, not seeing said I see. It was empty, false, untrue speech,” except in a case of superiority conceit, that bhikkhunī is pārājika, and shouldn’t live in community.
