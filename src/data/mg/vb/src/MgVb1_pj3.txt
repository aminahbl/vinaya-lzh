<beginh2>Final Ruling<endh2>


<beginchinese>若比丘尼自手奪人命。求持刀與殺者。教死歎死。咄人用惡活。為死勝生。作如是意如是想。方便歎譽死快。因是死非餘者。是比丘尼波羅夷。不應共住。<endchinese>

If a bhikkhunī with her own hand takes someone’s life, seeks and takes a knife to give to an assassin, teaches death, or praises death, saying: “Hey you, what use is this bad life? Death is better than living on!,” if, having such intentions and thoughts, she praises and glorifies the pleasure of death with skillful means, and someone dies for this reason, not for another reason, that bhikkhunī is pārājika, and shouldn’t live in community.
