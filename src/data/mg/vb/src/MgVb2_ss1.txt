<beginchinese>明十九僧殘法之一
受使行如比丘中廣說。是故世尊說。<endchinese>

<begindescription>Explanation of the 19 saṅghādisesa rules, part 1.<enddescription>


“Accepting to act as a messenger” is as explained in detail in the bhikkhu rules. This is what the World-honored One said. 




<beginh2>Final Ruling<endh2>


<beginchinese>若比丘尼受使行。和合男女若取婦若私通。乃至須臾頃。是法初罪僧伽婆尸沙。<endchinese>

If a bhikkhunī accepts to act as a messenger to unite a man and a woman, whether for a marriage or an affair, even for just one moment, it’s an immediate sanghadisesa offense.
