<beginh2>Origin Story<endh2>


<beginchinese>佛住舍衛城。爾時迦梨比丘尼。安居中受僧床褥已而捨遊行。
諸比丘尼以是因緣語大愛道瞿曇彌。乃至答言。實爾。佛言。汝云何安居中遊行。從今已後不聽。乃至已聞者當重聞。<endchinese>

The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time, Kālī bhikkhunī returned the bed and mat she had received from the sangha, and went wandering during the rains retreat.
For this reason, the bhikkhunīs spoke with Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī. … She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “Why did you wander during the rains retreat? From now on, it’s no longer allowed.” … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




<beginh2>Final Ruling<endh2>


<beginchinese>若比丘尼。安居中遊行者波夜提。<endchinese>

If a bhikkhunī wanders during the rains retreat, it’s a pācittiya.”




<beginh2>Explanation<endh2>


<beginchinese>安居者。前安居。後安居。行者。下至聚落宿波夜提。波夜提者如上說。若比丘尼。安居中離界一宿波夜提。若王難餘方賊來。若恐奪命。若畏失梵行者去無罪。比丘尼安居中。無有求聽羯磨法為塔僧事而遊行。是故世尊說。<endchinese>

“The rains retreat” means the first rains retreat or the second rains retreat. “Traveling” means even if she spends the night in the village, it’s a pācittiya. “Pācittiya” is as explained above. If a bhikkhunī leaves the territory overnight during the rains retreat, it’s a pācittiya. If a king creates trouble, if criminals come from elsewhere, if she fears for her life, if she’s afraid to be raped, and she leaves, there is no offense. During the rains retreat, there is no allowance for a bhikkhunī to ask for permission in a formal act in order to wander to a stupa or on sangha business. This is what the World-honored One said.
