<beginh2>Final Ruling<endh2>


<beginchinese>若比丘尼瞋恨不喜故。以異分事中小小事。非波羅夷比丘尼。以波羅夷法謗。欲破彼梵行。彼於後時若撿挍若不撿挍。以異分中小小事。是比丘尼住瞋恨故說。是法初罪。<endchinese>

If a bhikkhunī, out of hostility and dissatisfaction, slanders a bhikkhunī, who isn’t pārājika, with a pārājika offense because of a minor issue from a different matter, wanting to destroy her monastic life, and at a later time, whether examined or not examined about that minor issue from a different matter, that bhikkhunī says that she spoke because she harboured hostility, it’s an immediate offense.
