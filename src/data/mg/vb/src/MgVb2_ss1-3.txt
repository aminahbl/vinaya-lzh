<beginchinese>明十九僧殘法之一
受使行如比丘中廣說。是故世尊說。<endchinese>

Explanation of the 19 saṅghādisesa rules, part 1.


“Accepting to act as a messenger” is as explained in detail in the bhikkhu rules. This is what the World-honored One said. 




Final Ruling


<beginchinese>若比丘尼受使行。和合男女若取婦若私通。乃至須臾頃。是法初罪僧伽婆尸沙。<endchinese>

If a bhikkhunī accepts to act as a messenger to unite a man and a woman, whether for a marriage or an affair, even for just one moment, it’s an immediate sanghadisesa offense.

<beginchinese>二無根如比丘中廣說。是故世尊說。<endchinese>

Two rules on “unfounded,” as explained in detail in the bhikkhu rules. This is what the World-honored One said.




Final ruling


<beginchinese>若比丘尼瞋恨不喜故。於清淨無罪比丘尼。以無根波羅夷法謗。欲破彼比丘尼淨行。彼於後時若撿挍若不撿挍。便作是言。是事無根。我住瞋恨故作是語。是法初罪。<endchinese>

If a bhikkhunī out of hostility and dissatisfaction, slanders a pure, innocent bhikkhunī with an unfounded pārājika offense, wanting to destroy that bhikkhunī’s monastic life, and at a later time, whether examined or not examined, says: ‘This matter is unfounded. I said this because I was harbouring hostility,’ it’s an immediate offense.

Final Ruling


<beginchinese>若比丘尼瞋恨不喜故。以異分事中小小事。非波羅夷比丘尼。以波羅夷法謗。欲破彼梵行。彼於後時若撿挍若不撿挍。以異分中小小事。是比丘尼住瞋恨故說。是法初罪。<endchinese>

If a bhikkhunī, out of hostility and dissatisfaction, slanders a bhikkhunī, who isn’t pārājika, with a pārājika offense because of a minor issue from a different matter, wanting to destroy her monastic life, and at a later time, whether examined or not examined about that minor issue from a different matter, that bhikkhunī says that she spoke because she harboured hostility, it’s an immediate offense.
