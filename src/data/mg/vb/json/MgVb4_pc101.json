        "The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time, the World-honored One had laid down the precept that it’s not allowed to give the full ordination to a married woman who is less than 12 years old. Then bhikkhunīs gave the full ordinations to women living with their husbands’ families who were 12 years old. The bhikkhunīs were upset and said: “Whether you’re 12 year old women living with your husbands’ families or not, who knows?”",
        "The bhikkhunīs told Mahāpajāpatī, and she went to the World-honored One, and informed him. … The Buddha said: “From now on, a 12 year old married woman should be given the training precepts for two years.” The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī: “Convene all the bhikkhunīs living in the vicinity of Sāvatthī. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:"
