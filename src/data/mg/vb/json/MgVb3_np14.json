        "“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. The bowl in “storing a spare bowl” refers to an ordinary clay bowl<note>Sumbhaka</note>, a bowl similar to an ordinary clay bowl<note>Upa-sumbhaka</note>, a large bowl<note>Utkaṭeyaka</note>, and an irregularly shaped bowl<note>Vaṃkeṭaka</note>. These can be made from iron or clay. This is called “a bowl”. “A bowl” is also large, medium, or small; an over-sized bowl, an under-sized bowl, and a bowl for household usage. If she keeps them, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. A bhikkhunī may keep sixteen bowls: one determined bowl, three bowls as pure offerings (to others)<note>this refers to the vikappana procedure: transferring ownership to someone else</note>, four over-sized bowls, four under-sized bowls, and four bowls for household usage. If she keeps more, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. “A nissaggiya pācittiya” is as explained above. There is a limit to the spare bowls a bhikkhunī may keep. A bhikkhu may keep many (bowls) as pure offerings, and use them without offense. This is what the World-honored One said."
