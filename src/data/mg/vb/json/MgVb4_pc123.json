        "The Buddha was staying at Vesāli. At that time, Bhaddā bhikkhunī went to her relatives’ house, and when her brothers’ and sisters’ sons were in a dark place without a lamp, she suddenly entered there without first announcing herself. Then her relatives felt ashamed.",
        "The bhikkhunīs told Mahāpajāpatī, … She answered: “I really did this.” The Buddha said: “Why did you knowingly enter a place where men were staying in the dark without a lamp? From now on, it’s no longer allowed.” … Those who have already heard it should listen again:"

        "“A bhikkhunī” is as explained above. “A man is sitting” means a place for sleeping and lying down. “A dark place” means a place where they can’t see each other. “Without a lamp” means without an oil lamp, … or any other kind of lamp. If she enters, it’s a pācittiya. “Pācittiya” is as explained above. One may not enter a dark place where a man is sitting. If there’s a reason why she has to enter, if she hears that the people inside are loud and noisy, she may enter. If she can’t hear voices, she should first send someone in to speak with them, or snap her fingers, or light a lamp to make each other visible. If people call out for her to enter, she may enter. If she doesn’t speak, doesn’t snap her fingers, and doesn’t light a bright lamp, and still enters, it’s a pācittiya. If a bhikkhu enters without speaking, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is what the World-honored One said."
