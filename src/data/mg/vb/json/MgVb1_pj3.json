        "If a bhikkhunī with her own hand takes someone’s life, seeks and takes a knife to give to an assassin, teaches death, or praises death, saying: “Hey you, what use is this bad life? Death is better than living on!,” if, having such intentions and thoughts, she praises and glorifies the pleasure of death with skillful means, and someone dies for this reason, not for another reason, that bhikkhunī is pārājika, and shouldn’t live in community."
