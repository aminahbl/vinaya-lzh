If she takes something worth more than 16 old coins, it’s a nissaggiya pācittiya. “A nissaggiya pācittiya” is as explained above. A bhikkhunī may not buy a heavy robe worth more than 16 old coins. If she doesn’t ask and is offered a robe, even if it’s more expensive, there is no offense. For bhikkhunīs, there is this limit. For bhikkhus, there is no limit. Even if he knowingly takes an expensive robe, and uses it, there is no offense. This is what the World-honored One said."
