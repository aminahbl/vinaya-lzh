        "If a bhikkhunī, not yet knowing and understanding, claims to have attained a superhuman state, noble extraordinary knowledge and vision: “I know in this way, I see in this way,” and at a later time, whether she’s being examined or not examined about committing the offense, desiring purification, she says: “Venerables, I, not knowing said I know, not seeing said I see. It was empty, false, untrue speech,” except in a case of superiority conceit, that bhikkhunī is pārājika, and shouldn’t live in community."
