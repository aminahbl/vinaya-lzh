        "The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time, a bhikkhunī threw excrement and urine over a wall without looking first. Then a brahmin, having freshly bathed and having put on new, clean clothes, was walking on a road, and the things fell straight on his head. The brahmin abused her: “Renunciate, you’re an ordinary person. You soiled me like this!”",
        "The bhikkhunīs went and informed the Buddha. … She answered: “I really did this, World-honored One.” The Buddha said: “This is an unwholesome thing. Why did you throw away impure things without observing properly? From now on, it’s no longer allowed. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:"

        "“Partition wall” means screen, fence, or wall. “Throwing impure things” means excrement, urine, snot, spit, garbage, hand and foot washing water, hair, and fingernails. “Without observing” means throwing without looking first. If she wants to throw things away, she should first look properly. If many people walk there, she should wait until they’re gone before throwing. If there are few passer-bys, she should snap her fingers before throwing. If she throws without looking and without snapping her fingers, it’s a pācittiya. If a bhikkhu throws without looking, he breaks a minor vinaya rule. This is what the World-honored One said."
