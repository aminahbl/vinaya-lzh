Origin Story


<beginchinese>佛住毘舍離。爾時跋陀羅比丘尼到親里家共兄弟姊妹兒於屏處坐。比丘尼嫌言。云何出家人。與俗人隱處坐。猶如俗人。
以是因緣語大愛道。乃至佛言。從今已後。不聽共男子屏處坐乃至已聞者當重聞<endchinese>

The Buddha was staying at Vesāli. At that time, Bhaddā bhikkhunī went to her relatives’ house, and sat in a secluded place together with her brothers’ and sisters’ sons. The bhikkhunīs were upset and said: “Why does a renunciate sit with lay people in a hidden place, like a lay person?”
For this reason, they spoke with Mahāpajāpatī, … The Buddha said: “From now on, it’s no longer allowed to sit together with a man in a secluded place.” … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




Final Ruling


<beginchinese>若比丘尼與丈夫屏處坐波夜提。<endchinese>

If a bhikkhunī sits with a man in a secluded place, it’s a pācittiya.”




Explanation


<beginchinese>波夜提者如上比丘中廣說。是故世尊說。<endchinese>

This pācittiya is explained in detail above in the rule about “a bhikkhu”. This is what the World-honored One said.




Summary Verse


<beginchinese>持傘佉啁床 同敷床不捨
不白婬處宿 無伴故墟看
比丘靜處坐 男子亦復然
十二跋渠竟<endchinese>

Holding an umbrella, a couch bed, laying out beds, not giving up,
Not informing, spending the night in a place for sex, without a group, visiting ancient ruins,
Sitting with a bhikkhu in a quiet place, and likewise with a man,
The 12th chapter is finished.
