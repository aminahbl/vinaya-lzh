Origin Story


<beginchinese>佛住舍衛城。爾時世尊制戒。不聽滿十二雨適他婦二年學戒不滿與受具足。爾時比丘尼與適他婦二年學戒滿與受具足。諸比丘尼嫌言。汝學戒滿與不滿誰能知者。諸比丘尼語大愛道。大愛道以是事往白世尊。乃至佛告大愛道瞿曇彌。依止舍衛城住比丘尼皆悉令集。乃至已聞者當重聞。<endchinese>

The Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī. At that time, the World-honored One had laid down the precept that it’s not allowed to give the full ordination to a married woman, who is at least 12 years old, but who hasn’t completed training in the (sikkhamānā) precepts for two years. Then a bhikkhunī gave the full ordination to a married woman, who had completed training in the precepts for two years. The bhikkhunīs were upset and said: “Whether or not you’ve completed training in the precepts, who can know?” The bhikkhunīs told Mahāpajāpatī, and she went to the World-honored One, and informed him of this matter. … The Buddha told Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī: “Convene all the bhikkhunīs living in the vicinity of Sāvatthī. … Those who have already heard it should listen again:




Final Ruling


<beginchinese>若比丘尼已適他婦學戒滿。不羯磨與受具足者波夜提。<endchinese>

If a bhikkhunī gives the full ordination to a married woman, who has completed training in the precepts, without a formal act, it’s a pācittiya.”




Explanation


<beginchinese>如上童女不羯磨中廣說。<endchinese>

As explained in detail above in the rule about “a girl without formal act”.
